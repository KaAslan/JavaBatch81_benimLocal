   Get a String and a character from user
   Count the number of characters between the first occurence
   and the last occurence of the given character in the String

   Do not count the space characters
   If the character which user selected is displayed just once in the String return -1
   If the character which user selected does not exist in the String return -1
   For example; "Java is easy" - 'a' ==> 5
                "Java is easy" - 'w' ==> -1
                "Java is easy" - 'e' ==> -1
